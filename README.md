# Final-Prices-With-a-Special-Discount-in-a-Shop

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop.

There is a special discount for items in the shop. If you buy the ith item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[j] where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i]. Otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

Return an integer array answer where answer[i] is the final price you will pay for the ith item of the shop, considering the special discount.

class Solution:

    def finalPrices(self, prices: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n=len(prices)
        stack=[n-1]
        ans=[x for x in prices]
        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            while stack and prices[i]<prices[stack[-1]]:
                stack.pop()
            if stack: ans[i]-=prices[stack[-1]]
            stack.append(i)
        return ans
